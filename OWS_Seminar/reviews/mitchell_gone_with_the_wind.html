		<p>Not many books nowadays are 984 pages long, or set in the 1800's. But of course, some books remain classics, and Gone with the Wind is definitely one of them. Although it took my mother ages to persuade me to read it, and it took me at least 100 pages to get really into the book, after that I was unable to put the book down for almost 4 days in a row.</p>
		<p>Scarlett O' Hara is a feisty teenage girl, with everything a girl could possibly want. Mamy to wait on her, a loving family, wealth, men begging to dance with her, good looks and a sixteen inch waist. So when she falls for handsome Ashley Wilkes, and the start of the civil war is announced, her world begins to fall apart. At a ball in Twelve Oaks, she meets Rhett Butler. He's extremely rich and arrogant with a reputation for being a rogue and she forms her opinion of him almost at once.</p>
		<p>Then the war is announced and Scarlett's adventure begins. In order to make Ashley jealous, she marries Charles Hamilton. But after going away to fight the Yankees, Charles dies almost immediately. Although Scarlett is left a widow, she realises that she is going to have her first baby and, due to depression, she is sent to Atlanta. Scarlett's life then starts to change dramatically. Being a widow, she can only wear black, and must not talk to men. This makes life very hard for flirty sixteen-year-old Scarlett. Then the civil war really starts to become dangerous, and it is up to Scarlett to save herself.</p>
		<p>This book taught me a lot about the Civil war, and the language and the descriptions are amazing. This is a great historical read, and makes a good holiday read, as its long enough to keep you busy reading for at least a week. I loved Gone with the Wind, and I would highly recommend it to anyone over eleven who likes historical stories.</p>
