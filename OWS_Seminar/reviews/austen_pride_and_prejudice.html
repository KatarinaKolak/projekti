		<p>The book takes us on a journey along with the main character, as she deals with love, feelings, misunderstandings, relationships, people, and problems, both inside the family, and out. A lot of the stuff that she goes through, is very similar to what we experience in our daily lives. There is a lot to learn about how we should do certain things, and how we should not do certain things.</p>
		<p>Sometimes, we tend to overthink, overreact, or unnecessarily worry about certain situations and circumstances. Doing so, we only tire ourselves out even more. We need to understand that not controlling our emotions can directly send our happiness down the drain.</p>
		<p>Pride goes before a fall, they say. We should learn to control our pride before it trips us into a pit. No matter how good we might be at something, there is always room for improvement. We need to stay humble and focus on bettering ourselves.</p>
		<p>If you are in search of a novel that doesnâ€™t move too fast, and is loaded with valuable lessons, I would recommend Pride and Prejudice.</p>

        <h3>Jane Austen</h3>
        <p>Jane Austen was an English novelist whose works of romantic fiction, set among the landed gentry, earned her a place as one of the most widely read writers in English literature, her realism and biting social commentary cementing her historical importance among scholars and critics.</p>
		<p>Austen lived her entire life as part of a close-knit family located on the lower fringes of the English landed gentry. She was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as well as through her own reading. The steadfast support of her family was critical to her development as a professional writer. Her artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about 35 years old. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. From 1811 until 1816, with the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began a third, which was eventually titled Sanditon, but died before completing it.</p>
		<p>Austen's works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become widely accepted in academia as a great English writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a Janeite fan culture.</p>
