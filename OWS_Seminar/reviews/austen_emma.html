		<p>The story is told from the point of view of Emma: a headstrong, upper-class, twenty-year-old woman living with her father in the small village of Highbury. Determined not to marry, she enjoys spending her time matchmaking her friends, albeit mistakenly. I immediately warmed to Emma’s character; her constant witty remarks and satirical sense of humour (as well as her arguably feminist approach to matrimony) made the book much more enjoyable, even making me laugh out loud more than once.</p>
		<p>After meeting a seventeen-year-old girl called Harriet Smith from the local boarding school, Emma quickly befriends her, takes her under her wing and once again plays the role of matchmaker. Having persuaded Harriet to reject a marriage proposal from Mr Martin, a farmer whom Harriet was infatuated with, Emma directs her attentions higher up, to the local vicar Mr Elton. The only problem is that Philip Elton has set his sights on Emma! In a rather awkward (yet amusing) carriage ride, Mr Elton suddenly declares his love for Emma, which she swiftly rejects, leaving her feeling confused and guilty for poor Harriet.</p>
		<p>The novel truly was a page-turner; I was so invested with each character’s story and was therefore very happy with the ending. I love a good romance, and Austen’s skilful use of irony and humour made the novel a true joy to read. Following the entire story from Emma’s point of view ensured that every twist and turn was a total surprise. In spite of the slight language difficulty, I would definitely recommend Emma to anyone looking for a light-hearted, humorous romance, and I could happily read this book again and again!</p>

        <h3>Jane Austen</h3>
        <p>Jane Austen was an English novelist whose works of romantic fiction, set among the landed gentry, earned her a place as one of the most widely read writers in English literature, her realism and biting social commentary cementing her historical importance among scholars and critics.</p>
		<p>Austen lived her entire life as part of a close-knit family located on the lower fringes of the English landed gentry. She was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as well as through her own reading. The steadfast support of her family was critical to her development as a professional writer. Her artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about 35 years old. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. From 1811 until 1816, with the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began a third, which was eventually titled Sanditon, but died before completing it.</p>
		<p>Austen's works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become widely accepted in academia as a great English writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a Janeite fan culture.</p>
